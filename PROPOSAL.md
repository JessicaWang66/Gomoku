# Proposal #

**Author: Yucheng Jiang**
## Project Overview ##
- Create a C++ implementation of Gomuku game
- Some library might be used
  - imGUI of Cinder 


## Goal ##

- Learn using GUI and Graphics
- Learn using basic AI to implement auto player

## Week 1 ##

- Establish business model
  - Game board
  - Judging win and lose
  - Game player playing process
  - Create game player abstract class
  - Create standard for recording each game
- Establish user interface model
  - Design UI component
  - Write outline of UI functions and portals

## Week 2 ##

- Implement business model
  - Implement random auto player
  - Implement human player (through console input)
  - Implement advanced auto player

- Test business model
  - Test game process
  - Test human player
  - Test random and advanced auto player

## Week 3 ##

- Implement user interface model
  - display game board
- Improve business model
  - improve auto player (using multiple thread)
  - add another naive auto player

## Extra ##

- Keep improving AI auto player such as using convolutional and recurrent neural network
